# Assignment 3: Understanding Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

This project implements and analyzes two core topics in algorithm design:
1. **Randomized Quicksort vs. Deterministic Quicksort**
2. **Hash Table with Chaining**

The goal is to compare theoretical efficiency with empirical performance, and to evaluate scalability under different conditions.
